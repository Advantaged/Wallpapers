### Advantaged Wallpapers
Here is a desktop background that is well tolerated for the eyes, for the screen, for power consumption & for the thinking machine :wink:.
**Note:** All wallpapers are in `*.ipg` format. This's a vector-format saving storage-place & you can edit with a simple text-editor.
#### **Where to store:**
- 1.1. Make first a sub-folder in your `~/Pictures` names `Wallpapers` (if you want to download more than one).
- 1.2. Make anyway a sub-folder under your `~/Pictures` names `Advantaged` or the name you prefer


- [x] **Done & Enjoy !** :wink:
