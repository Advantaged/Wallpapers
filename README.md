### Advantaged Wallpapers
Here is a desktop background that is well tolerated for the eyes, for the screen, for power consumption & for the thinking machine :wink:.
**Note:** All wallpapers are in `*.ipg` format. This's a vector-format saving storage-place & you can edit with a simple text-editor.
#### **Where to store:**
- 1.1. Make first a sub-folder in your `~/Pictures` names `Wallpapers` (if you want to download more than one).
- 1.2. Make anyway a sub-folder under your `~/Pictures` names `Advantaged` or the name you prefer in whitch-one you want store the picture-s.
- 1.3. The CLI-commands are respectively:
```
mkdir ~/Pictures/Wallpapers/Advantaged

mkdir ~/Pictures/Advantaged
```
- 1.4. If your machine has multiple users & you want that every user is able to "install" these/those wallpapers, than are many folder at your choice, e.g.:
```
sudo mkdir /usr/share/wallpapers/Advantaged/

sudo cp ~/Pictures/Advantaged/Advantaged_3840x2160_181a1b.jpg \
/usr/share/wallpapers/Advantaged/Advantaged4K.jpg
```


- [x] **Done & Enjoy !** :wink:
